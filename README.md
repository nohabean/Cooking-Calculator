# Cooking Calculator

There are 2 different calculators available:
- A measurement conversion calculator
- A cook time and temperature calculator

The measurement conversion calculator asks users to input standard cooking measurements and a number indicating how much they want to reduce or multiple the measurement by. Returned and displayed to the user is the new reduced measurements. This can be helping when trying to reduce measurements such as 1/4 cup in half, which would be 1/8 cup which does not exist. However, 1/8 cup is equal to 2 tablespoons, so this app would convert this and show 2 TBSP as the result.

The cook time and remperature calculator asks users to enter their recipes cook time and temperature. The user can then choose to modify the cook temperature or modify the cook time. Next, the user will be prompted to enter the desired cook temperature or cook time depending on which button they clicked previously. The units will load automatically based on the previously selected input. After clicking the calculate button, the resulting new cook time or new cook temperature result will display with the appropriate units. This could be useful when in a time crunch and you need to cook faster than you have time for or if you are trying to cook two different dishes at the same time but the recipes are calling for different cook times and temperatures.
